# 🔒 Security Policy

Thank you for helping make the internet safer.

## 📬 Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a vulnerability in any of my public projects or during an authorized assessment:
- Please email **security@secengineerx.com** *(or your preferred contact)*  
- Include clear, reproducible details (steps, PoC, or screenshots)
- Allow reasonable time for triage and patching before any public disclosure

## 🧭 Disclosure Philosophy
I follow the [Responsible Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) standard — ethical, coordinated, and educational.  
All findings are shared privately first, with the goal of helping developers secure their systems before exploitation becomes possible.

## 🧰 Scope
This repository exists for **ethical research, case studies, and awareness**.  
- No unauthorized testing or exploitation of live systems.  
- All assessments are performed **with prior consent** or on **owned assets**.  

## 🕒 Response Time
I aim to:
- Acknowledge reports within **48 hours**
- Provide updates within **7 days**
- Publicly disclose resolved issues after mutual agreement
